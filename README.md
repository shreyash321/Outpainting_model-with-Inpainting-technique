# Outpainting_model-with-Inpainting-technique
In my code, I first generate two images: an extended image, which is 128 pixels extended from the original, and a mask image. 
These preprocessed images are then fed into a Runway inpainting model that outpaints the given image based on a user prompt.

# Here is the sample image  generated from the model
